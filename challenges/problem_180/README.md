Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack 
with the second half reversed using only one other queue. 

This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

Examples:
 
Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Output: `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
Output: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`
Output: `[1, 11, 2, 10, 3, 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, 6]`
